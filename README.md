# vscpl1drv-can232
VSCP Level I driver for devices

<img src="https://vscp.org/images/logo.png" width="100">

vscpl1drv-can232 is a VSCP level I driver ([CANAL driver](https://docs.vscp.org/#canal)) for the **Lawicel CAN232** CAN adapter and other compatible **slcan** devices.

The linux port of this driver is created by (ice@geomi.org)

Info about the adapter is available at (https://www.can232.com)

This driver interface is for the can232 adapter from Lawicel (or other slcan drivers). This is a low cost CAN adapter that connects to one of the serial communication ports on a computer. The driver can handle the adapter in both polled and non polled mode, which handled transparently to the user. It is recommended however that the following settings are made before real life use.

* Set the baud rate for the device to 115200. You do this with the U1 command. This is the default baud rate used by this driver.
* Set auto poll mode by issuing the X1 command.
* Enable the time stamp by issuing the Z1 command.

## Platforms
  * Linux
  * Windows

## Driver for Windows

```bash
vscpl1drv_can232.dll
```

## Driver for Linux

```bash
vscpl1drv-can232.so
```
## Install location

### Linux

From version 14.0.0 the driver is installed in */var/lib/vscp/drivers/level1*

### Windows

From version 14.0.0 the driver is installed in */program files/vscpd/drivers/level1*

## Configuration string

All level I drivers are configured using a semicolon separated configuration string.

The driver string has the following format (note that all values can be entered in either decimal or hexadecimal form (for hex precede with 0x).

```bash
> comport;baudrate;mask;filter;bus-speed[;btr0;btr1]
```

###  comport
The serial communication port to use. 

For windows use *1,2,3...* 

For Linux use */dev/ttyS0, /dev/ttyUSB1* etc.

### baudrate
A valid baud rate for the **serial interface** ( for example. 9600 ).

### mask (optional)
The mask for the adapter. Read the Lawicel CAN232 manual on how to set this. It is not the same mask as for CANAL/VSCP.

#### filter (optional)
The filter for the adapter. Read the Lawicel CAN232 manual on how to set this. It is not the same as for CANAL/VSCP.

### bus-speed
is the speed or the **CAN interface**. Valid values are

| Setting | Bus-speed |
| :-----: | :---------: |
| 10 | 10Kbps |
| 20 | 20Kbps |
| 50 | 50Kbps |
| 100 |  100Kbps |
| 125 | 125Kbps |
| 250 | 250Kbps |
| 500 | 500Kbps |
| 800 | 800Kbps |
| 1000 | 1Mbps |

### btr0/btr1 (Optional.)
Instead of setting a bus-speed you can set the SJA1000 BTR0/BTR1 values directly. If both are set the bus_speed parameter is ignored.

### Defaults

If no device string is given COM1/ttyS0 will be used. Baud rate will be set to 115200 baud and the filter/mask to fully open. The CAN bit rate will be 500Kbps.

## Flags

 Not used. Set to zero.

## Status return

The CanalGetStatus call returns the status structure with the channel_status member having the following meaning:

 | Bit      | Description |
 | ---      | ----------- |
 | Bit 0-7  | TX Error Counter. |
 | Bit 8-15 | RX Error Counter. |
 | Bit 16   | Overflow. Cleard by status read. |
 | Bit 17   | RX Warning. |
 | Bit 18   | TX Warning. |
 | Bit 19   | TX bus passive. |
 | Bit 20   | RX bus passive. |
 | Bit 21   | Reserved. |
 | Bit 22   | Reserved. |
 | Bit 23   | Reserved. |
 | Bit 24   | Reserved. |
 | Bit 25   | Reserved. |
 | Bit 26   | Reserved. |
 | Bit 27   | Reserved. |
 | Bit 28   | Reserved. |
 | Bit 29   | Bus Passive. |
 | Bit 30   | Bus Warning status. |
 | Bit 31   | Bus off status |

## Example configurations

```bash
> 5;115200;0;0;1000
```

Uses COM5 at 115200 with filters/masks open to receive all messages and with 1Mbps CAN bit rate.

```bash
> /dev/ttyUSB1;57600;0;0;0;0x09;0x1C
```

On Linux uses serial USB adapter 1 at 57600 baud with filters/masks open to receive all messages and with a CAN bit-rate set to 50Kbps using btr0/btr1

## Typical settings for VSCP daemon config

### Linux

```xml
<!-- The can232 driver -->
<driver enable="false" 
        name="can232"
        config="/dev/ttyS0;19200;0;0;125"
        flags="0"
        translation="0x02"
        path="/var/lib/vscp/drivers/level1/vscpl1drv-can232.so"
        guid="FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:F5:01:00:00:00:00:00:00:04"
/>
```

### Windows

```xml
<!-- The can232 driver -->
<driver enable="false"
        name="can232"
        config="com1"
        flags="0"
        translation="0x02"
        path="/program files/vscpd/drivers/level1/vscpl1drv-can232.so"
        guid="FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:F5:01:00:00:00:00:00:00:04"
/>
```


## Install the driver on Linux

Install Debian package

```bash
> sudo apt install ./vscpl2drv-can232_1.1.0-1_amd64.deb
```

using the latest version from the repositories [release section](https://github.com/grodansparadis/vscpl1drv-can232/releases).

or

```
./configure 
./make
sudo make install
```

use the switch **--enable-debug** if you want a debug build.

## Install the driver on Linux using vscp private repository

**Warning !!!** *Currently this is very much experimental*

```bash
wget -O - http://apt.vscp.org/apt.vscp.org.gpg.key | sudo apt-key add -
```

then add

```bash
deb http://apt.vscp.org/debian buster main
deb http://apt.vscp.org/debian eoan main
```

to the file

```bash
/etc/apt/sources.list
```

replace **eoan** with the os-release you have installed and **debian** to *debian*, *ubuntu* or *raspian*

## Install the driver on Windows
Install using the binary install file in the release section.

## How to build the driver on Linux

sudo apt update && sudo apt -y upgrade
sudo apt install build-essential git
```
